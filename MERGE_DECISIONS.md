# Merge Decisions Documentation

## Integration Branch: integration/unified-ui

### Merge Strategy
Based on the feature comparison matrix, we merged `feat-ipad-responsive-screens` into `main` as it provided significant responsive design improvements while maintaining all existing functionality.

### Completed Merges

#### 1. main → integration/unified-ui
- **Status**: ✅ Completed (base branch)
- **Decision**: Used main as the foundation with complete feature set

#### 2. feat-ipad-responsive-screens → integration/unified-ui  
- **Status**: ✅ Completed via fast-forward merge
- **Key features incorporated**:
  - Adaptive sizing utilities (`lib/utils/adaptive_sizes.dart`)
  - Responsive design improvements across all tutorial screens
  - iPad-optimized layouts for learning module
  - Adaptive dotted background widget
  - Enhanced responsive components
